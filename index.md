# __Overview__
#### *Computer Assisted Warfare*
Confucian Ethics is an ethics that is extremely situational, so there is no black and white answer to whether or not computer-assisted warfare is ethical or not. For the most part, our ethical framework would oppose computer-assisted warfare because thought Confucian Ethics is situational, it’s also based on relationships. Warfare of any kind, computer-assisted or not, would obviously ruin any kind of relationship between the opposing sides, so for this reason our framework would oppose computer-assisted warfare. On the other hand, we are also interested in the intent of an action. If computer-assisted warfare were deemed absolutely necessary to settle a conflict, and the ultimate intent was to offer help to an issue in some way, this would be a situation where computer-assisted warfare was deemed ethical. Again, it is situationally dependent where the intent of the action is the most important decision factor on whether or not the action is ethical according to our framework.

#### *Diversity in the Technology Sector*
Being based in the B.C. era, confucian ethics is written to perpetuate stereotypical gender roles. However confucian ethics places more importance on core values such as benevolence and justice. Although in one instance confucian ethics may say that a woman is meant to fulfill her role as a mother, we should also remember that in context with our current times there is no reason that confucian ethics would consider this view as more important than making sure a underrepresented group is empowered to follow their life path. Furthermore the tech industry is based around a culture of teamwork, which could be considered to closely resemble family. Confucian ethics would largely denounce acts of undermining and hostility in the workplace. A family wouldn’t expect people to change and conform when confronted with malevolence. Instead they would embrace the differences and determine how they could best foster the growth of that individual. In the same way confucian ethics would denounce harmful ethnic stereotypes. If a environment is created where people don’t feel welcomed among their peers, then clearly something drastic would have to change. When viewing the workplace with the same regard as family confucian ethics would make facilitating a welcoming environment that facilitates the growth of each individual the top priority of a company when examining how their decisions are impacting the diversity of their workplace.  

#### *Online Censorship*
In all likelihood, a framework like Confucian ethics would be in support of online censorship if it were in response to hateful or discriminatory content. One of the core teachings of Confucianism is the universality of actions, or the “golden rule”: do unto others as you would have them do unto you. In respect to this guiding concept, this framework would be strongly against the posting of hateful content. No group of people that discriminates against others would want the same action turned around on them. The deletion of hateful content and censoring of those who choose to participate in it becomes the responsibility of companies in order to act ethically. As an ethics of virtue, Confucianism looks to act in a way that promotes the overall wellbeing of others. For this reason, it would be the responsibility of websites to censor content when necessary. However, Confucian ethics would view these on a case by case basis. It would recognize the importance of not controlling everything that was being shared, but just trying to promote things in a virtuous way. There would definitely be backlash from this selective censorship, as some would believe it infringes on a freedom of speech, but in order to follow the Confucian framework it would be necessary to recognize and act on situations requiring censorship. Treatment of others how one would like to be treated, and doing so in a virtuous way, should act as guiding factors in recognizing what should be censored.

#### *Algorithm*

  is_decision_ethical(decision)

  	ethical = True

    For relationship in my relationships

    	If decision does not satisfy my duties in the relationship

    		ethical = False

    For virtue in confucian virtues

    	If decision exemplifies virtue

    		ethical = True

    Return ethical

We believe that this algorithm captures the key parts of the Confucian Ethics. It captures that the Confucian Ethics is mainly concerned with relationships and virtues. Something is considered ethical according to the Confucian Ethics if it satisfies the duties that you have in all your relationships or it exemplifies some specific virtue. Our algorithm evaluates a decision according to those considerations. If a decision is input it is assumed to be unethical unless it satisfies the duties you have in all your relationships or it is found to exemplify one of the virtues in the Confucian Ethics.
