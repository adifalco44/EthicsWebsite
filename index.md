### __Purpose__
Confucian Ethics emphasize a focus on the relationships between human beings. It is an ethics of virtue that believes in the importance defining virtues and principles in relation to one another. Through Confucian Ethics, it is believed that one achieves the fullest personhood by marking their relationships with mutual care and respect. In summary, Confucianism is based entirely on kindness, mutual respect, and an appreciation for character virtues. It is founded on the belief that a society can only find success when people learn to interact positively with one another. Based on this short summary, an action would be considered ethical through the lens of Confucian Ethics if it focused on positively impacting the relationship between individuals involved with both parties acting with kindness and a mutual respect for one another. For example, if an employee were to make a mistake while working on a project the response for their boss would not be one of anger resulting in punishment. In order to align with Confucian Ethics, the boss would help their employee understand the problem and how to fix it without the need for punishment, as this would have a negative impact on their established relationship.
### __Are ethics necessary?__
The social philosophy of Confucianism is based in acting with ren, or compassion in relation to others. This in and of itself shows the predisposition to act ethically, specifically in relation to other human beings, as the very basis of their belief system. This is further represented by the Golden Rule of Confucianism: “What you do not wish for yourself, do not do to others”. Confucius argues that humans are responsible for their own actions and especially for their treatment of others. In addition to this, one of the core concepts of Confucianism is that of the relationship between junzi and dao. Junzi represents someone who is of “ethical nobility” or the ideal virtuous and ethical person. A way in which a person can attain this ethical nobility is to follow the dao, or the way human beings should live their lives.  
In conclusion, those who follow Confucianism are predisposed to act ethically for two main reasons: they understand the importance of relationships with others and social order so Confucianists will act ethically in relation to other humans in order to keep this social order in balance. Additionally, the core concept of the relationship between junzi and dao give Confucianists a more direct way of leading an ethical life in order to become a person of ethical nobility. “The junzi is the ethical exemplar with the virtues making it possible to follow the dao.” (from https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-chinese/#VirEthDaoJunRen)
### __Human Computer Interaction & AI__
A large focus of Confucian ethics is on human relationships and using virtue as a guide in these. In response to this, this ethical framework would likely focus largely on the various aspects of computer technology that affect how humans interact and form relationships, both in good and bad ways. This can appear in various ways, from the ease of global communication, to the ability to act anonymously, and further to the idea how virtue can connect with artificial intelligence. One impact that would likely be a polarizing topic is simply how humans are able to communicate with one another. Computer technology has allowed people to stay in touch with friends and family all over the globe. We are able to see and share in happy and sad moments from across the country, which allows relationships to foster mutual care and respect, even when not in close proximity. On the other hand, computer technology has changed how humans interact and form relationships in regular life. It can act as a distraction and prevent a caring relationship from being formed, and while it may not directly cause one to act without virtue, it may inhibit them from living out their life to the degree they should, as the concept of dao states. In a more direct opposition, the anonymity of the internet has led to people acting with no compassion for others, and created a platform for expression that directly opposes Confucian beliefs. On a different note, another concept that Confucian ethics would likely consider would be the advancement of artificial intelligence, and how virtue and relationships are changed or implemented when a non-human thing is present. While it is likely that the approach would remain largely unchanged, questions would be raised over whether artificial intelligence can participate in mutual care and compassion with a human.
### __Confucian Ethics & IEEE__
##### *Similarities*
Both the IEEE code of ethics and the Confucian Ethics appear to be a collection of values which are held to be aspirational rather than consequences of a single unifying principle. Furthermore, both the IEEE code of ethics and the Confucian Ethics are very concerned with an individual's relationships with those around them; the IEEE code of ethics has parts about how to act in relation to colleagues, customers, and the public at large that are all slightly different. Lastly, both the IEEE code of ethics and the Confucian Ethics are flexible with regard to people all being slightly different and having different needs and abilities. The IEEE code of ethics point 6 specifically acknowledges that one should act essentially to the best of their ability and the Confucian Ethics has different suggestions for different people such as whether or not to confront your elders when they are apparently wrong.
##### *Differences*
First, the IEEE code of ethics and the Confucian Ethics differ in how they inform one’s actions. Whereas, the Confucian Ethics consists of values that are aspirational and leaves it to the individual to decide how to act such that they have those values, the IEEE code of ethics explicitly describes what one should do. For example, the IEEE code of ethics explicitly says to reject bribery whereas the Confucian Ethics would suggest that to be honest is aspirational and leave it to the individual that, that includes rejecting bribery. Additionally, the IEEE code of ethics and the Confucian Ethics differ slightly in how the recommendations that they make about interacting with different people. The IEEE code of ethics states that one should not discriminate based on a host of attributes (point 8), which is to say that one should not change how one behaves with other people based on those attributes. It does not appear that the Confucian Ethics would agree with this approach since a core part of it is that one should have different values based on the person that they are interacting with. That is not to say that Confucian Ethics would necessarily result in one treating others worse based on those attributes but perhaps differently which the IEEE code of ethics condemns.
##### *Lessons*
The Confucian Ethics would add to the IEEE code of ethics by introducing at the least a reason for behaving in the way that it describes. That is the IEEE code of ethics provides no underlying reason for behaving in the way that it describes (perhaps because it is believed to be self evident) and that is something that the aspiriational values in the Confucian Ethics could provide.
### __Confucian Ethics & ACM__
##### *Similarities*
Both the ACM code of ethics and Confucian Ethics share a central theme of setting guidelines towards being virtuous person, both in personal life and daily work. The first code of ACM members is that they will “contribute to society and human well-being” and in Confucian Ethics the ideal of junzi embodies ethical nobility. With junzi comes respect for social forms of conduct and the ability to discern what is right in any situation. This same belief is consistent through the ACM code of ethics through codes such as, “be honest and trustworthy”, “honor confidentiality”, and “respect existing laws pertaining to professional work”.
##### *Differences*
The ACM is much more structured than Confucian Ethics. In Confucian Ethics correct behavior is defined through virtue. The virtue itself comes from Confucius's teachings on the ideals of junzi, dao, ren, and li, saying that when one strives to embody these virtues they reach a full state of ren, or “personal ethicalness”. The ACM structures itself in two ways, one by separating teachings between “code” and “guidelines” and two by separating the code of ethics into four sections with importance placed on specific members depending on the section. The “code” are statements intended to be followed by all members and embody the general beliefs of the ACM, as it’s not designed to frequently change. In ACM, these codes are present as much more direct statements of what to follow than the ideals of virtue presented in Confucian Ethics. The ACM also sets a framework for termination of membership when its principles are not upheld.
##### *Lessons*
Confucian Ethics could greatly add to the guidelines in the ACM code of ethics by introducing the notion of virtue as a reason for acting in an ethical way. For example, code 2.5 states to get full analysis, including risk, of your system to the public. The guideline goes on to give reasons such as “you’re in a position of public trust”. If there were emphasized through concepts like Dao then each code would have one overarching theme of virtue as guidance as well.
### __Confucian Ethics & ICCP__
##### *Similarities*
A major aspect of Confucian Ethics is the idea of having a life full relationships built on mutual care and respect. There are a few subsections in the ICCP Code of Ethics that directly relate to this. For example, the ICCP code stresses both accepting and providing reviews of your work and others work (2.4) and the creation of opportunities for people around you to learn and grow as professionals (3.5). Both of these tenets of ICCP would promote learning opportunities that allow the workers to better themselves and their skills, which is the same method that Confucian Ethics would take to address problems and build relationships. In addition, the ICCP ethics mention the importance of being honest and trustworthy (1.3) and being fair and not discriminating (1.4). Both of these are virtuous actions that would strengthen your relationships due to the respect it would show.
##### *Differences*
The ICCP code of ethics seem to put a strong emphasis on performing public good. In fact, the very first tenet it mentions (1.1) is “Contribute to society and human well-being.” It also mentions “foster public awareness” (2.7),  and “ensure that public good is the central concern” (3.1). While Confucian Ethics do have a major emphasis on acting virtuous, it doesn’t explicitly specify that it has to be for the public as opposed to how you carry yourself and your interactions with others.
##### *Lessons*
ICCP’s code makes references to the workplace, such as providing and receiving reviews and being a team member, but it doesn’t really talk about maintaining social order. Confucian ethics make mention of respecting the position of those around you and maintaining social order, so by adding a tenet into the ICCP code, then one could specify the importance of working in a team and respecting those around you, which fits in with the respect and trustworthiness already mentioned in 1.3.
